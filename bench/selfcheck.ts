/**
 * Suite integrity check — no agent, no tokens, fully local.
 *
 * For every task in suite.json:
 *   1. Copy the fixture to a temp dir and run its verify command —
 *      it must FAIL (a fixture that passes as shipped is not a real task).
 *   2. Overlay the reference solution from bench/solutions/<id>/ and run
 *      verify again — it must PASS (proves the task is actually solvable
 *      and the tests match the spec).
 *
 * Run: bun bench/selfcheck.ts   (also: bun run bench:selfcheck)
 * Exit 1 if any task is broken. Run this after adding or editing a task.
