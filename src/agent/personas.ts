/**
 * Subagent personas — persona-as-data (Claude Code pattern).
 *
 * A persona bundles: system prompt, tool allowlist, preferred routing tier,
 * and a loop cap. Read-only personas run without permission prompts and can
 * fan out in parallel; write-capable personas go through the normal
 * permission flow once at delegation time.
 *
 * The token story: exploration noise (file dumps, grep output) stays inside
 * the subagent's context and dies with it — only the final report returns to
 * the parent conversation.
