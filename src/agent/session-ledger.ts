/**
 * Session ledger — durable, out-of-context session memory.
 *
 * A plain-markdown file recording what happened this session: files touched,
 * commands run, decisions made, compaction summaries. It is NOT injected into
 * every request (that would duplicate history and waste input tokens). Instead:
 *
 *   - the system prompt carries one stable line pointing at the ledger path;
 *     any routed model can read_file it on demand when context has been
 *     compacted past the details it needs;
 *   - compaction appends its summary here, so compacted details stay
 *     recoverable instead of vanishing;
 *   - entries from tool calls are written mechanically — zero LLM cost.
 *
 * With per-request model routing, this is the shared notebook every model in
 * the session can consult, regardless of which turns it personally served.
